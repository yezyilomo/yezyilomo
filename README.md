# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yezy, I'm making the world a better place to both developers and end users by creating great and simple to use APIs and UIs.

I like listening to music, playing guitar and watching movies. If you would like to discuss anything about my work or personal projects, you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yezyilomo).
